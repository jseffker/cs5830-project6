## TODOs
As he mentioned, a big part of what we'll be doing is looking at data over time, because a lot of the data depends on time. Some useful things to do will be to:
- Plot each variable over time, and overlay that with the observed variable
- Cut the data out so it's a year at a time that we're looking at, and for using linear regression, it might need to be that we cut it up by uptrend season and then down trend, as they all seem to correlate with going up in the winter and then down in the summer if I remember correctly.
- Make a scatterplot of the different variables placed over each other to see the trends and to see which data doesn't have the same trends as observed through the year.
